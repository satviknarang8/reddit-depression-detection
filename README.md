# Reddit Depression Detection

## Project Overview
This project recreates the results from the paper "Detecting Symptoms of Depression on Social Media."
The goal of this project is to use posts on Reddit to train a random forest classifier to predict symptoms of depression.
This involves extracting features from the posts using two approaches: topic modeling with LDA and contextual embeddings with DistilRoBERTa.
Both models are evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation to compute AUC scores.

## How to Run
Run all the cells in the notebook sequentially.
